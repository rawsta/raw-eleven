Another side-project by rawsta.

This time it's a page with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) with [Pack11ty](https://pack11ty.dev/) as starter-template. Maybe it's kind of cheating to use templates but the day only has so many hours.

[Pack11ty]{.pack11ty} is an heavily opinionated [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) template project originally created by [NicolasÂ Hoizey](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/).
